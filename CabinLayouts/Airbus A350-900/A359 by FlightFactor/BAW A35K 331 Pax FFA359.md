The BAW A35K 331 Pax CabinLayout for SelfLoadingCargo is based on a hybrid British Airways A350-1000 Seat Layout and the Flight Factor A350-900 XWB Door Layout.

British Airways does not operate Airbus A350-900s.
The FlightFactor A350-900 XWB has its own seat layout for a maximum of 290 passenger, but you can consider any additiona passenger as "cargo" for a correct simulated payload operation.
